# ToDo

This is a roadmap and a ToDo list for contash. If you want to contibute, post an issue and I'll put it on the listâ€¦

- hook to Contaos backend to be able to run Contao system functions such as the `InstallTool`, `PurgeData`, `CronJob` or what ever
- drop DOCUMENTROOT in favor for current directory or some other directory provided as a parameter
- create a help message invoked `contash -h` or `contash --help`
- establish a usage like `contash [options] <command> [args]`
